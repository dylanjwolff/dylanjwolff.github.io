<h6><em>PhD Candidate in Computer Science at NUS</em></h6>

<h4>About Me</h4>
<p>I am currently pursuing my PhD at the <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a>, advised by <a href="https://abhikrc.com/">Abhik Roychoudhury</a>. 
Before this, I completed my masters at <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zürich</a>.
Previously, I also have worked at <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/">Mathworks</a> on a variety of projects, mostly involving testing and deployment infrastructure for web applications.</p>
<p>My research goals revolve around using program analysis to find, prevent, and fix bugs in real-world software.
Recently, I have been focused on investigating novel automated testing approaches for concurrent programs. 
I’ve created several systems which can replace the OS scheduler to deterministically control and reorder concurrent program executions.
Along with these systems, I’ve developed novel randomized algorithms which can efficiently search the space of (sequentially consistent) instruction interleavings for interesting program behaviors or bugs.
In my past research, I’ve worked on components for a Rust verification framework and a domain specific fuzzer for SMT solvers.</p>
<h4>Fun Fact:</h4>
<p>I am a (semi)-retired competitive ultimate frisbee player. 
Over the course of roughly 12 years of competition, I played in two different semi-professional leagues and also won a world championship in 2013 with team USA in Toronto.</p>
<h4>About This Site:</h4>
<p>This website was created with a simple static site generator I wrote in Rust.
You can see the code for it on my <a href="https://github.com/dylanjwolff/rusty-ssg">Github</a>.</p>
